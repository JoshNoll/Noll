<h1> The History of Spoons

<h2> Since the 4th Century, the Spoons and Forks have been at war, fighting for survival and bragging rights. When this war ends, we can finally figure out what type of silverware is better.

<h2> The Knives refuse to help either of the sides, they've been watching them fight for about 700 years.
<h2> The Spoon King and Queen are coming up with an agreement that the Forks might like, but were not too sure.
<h2> The main reason they hate each other is because of their shape, one is round and the other is spiked.
